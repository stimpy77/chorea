How wonderful.

##What this is (currently)

A playground of some interfaces and classes that make it easy to run an actor-like microservice-ish component and send data back using a basic messaging subsystem.
Actually, there is nothing actor-like in here at all yet. There's some subprocess-y stuff in here though.

##What I want

* Putting Object Oriented Programming mindset on steroids (complete with known side-effects) by making simple objects self-contained and encapsulated
* Habitually write software to be reactive to external messages rather than directly programmatically activated
* Enjoy a simplified framework that minimizes the cost of such patterns so that they aren't IES (Intimidating Enterprise Software, zomg)
* Think in these components' APIs rather than the interfaces of my favorite language
* Implement with interfaces and pre-built support containers rather than inherit "Actors" or "Messages"; use composition
* The return of "LAN testing"--late night LAN parties at the office
